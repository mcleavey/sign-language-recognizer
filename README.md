# sign-language-recognizer
Trains a Hidden Markov Model to recognize American Sign Language words on a video. It then uses a Language Model to improve full sentence recognition.  This is based on a Udacity project - I was able to achieve significantly better recognition (65% with just the HMM and 77% with the language model) than was expected in the class (40-50% recognition was required to pass).
